# FREENOVE ESP32 WROVER Camera

## Installation

Coming Soon

## What is the FREENOVE ESP32 WROVER board?

## How is this board being used here?

From the tutorials given from FREENOVE, these are the projects to understand the board and eventually build a camera webserver.

My perspective is to create a platform to showcase and develop image processing techniques.
