# FREENOVE ESP32 WROVER Camera

## Installation

Coming Soon

## What is the FREENOVE ESP32 WROVER board?

## How is this board being used here?

From the tutorials given from FREENOVE, these are the projects to understand the board and eventually build a camera webserver.

My perspective is to create a platform to showcase and develop image processing techniques.


## Projects

*Tip: Create a header file titled secrets.h and add your SSID (WiFi name) and Password. the .gitignore will prevent it from going to a public git repo.*

### 1.1 Blink

### 2.2 BLE USART

### 4.1 WIFI Station

### 4.2 WIFI AP

### 5.2 WIFI Server

Sets up the ESP32 board as a client. This project has you connect to a virtual server created on Processing (application you download).

*Tip: Turn off firewalls to allow communication with the device.*
